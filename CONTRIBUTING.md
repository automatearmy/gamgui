## Contributing Guidelines

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names with prefixes:
- `feature/` - New features
- `bugfix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation changes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Adding or updating tests

Examples:

### Commit Messages

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for automatic changelog generation:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation only changes
- `style:` - Changes that don't affect code meaning (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat(auth): add Google OAuth integration
fix(session): resolve session timeout issues
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

## Coding Standards

### Backend (Python)

- Use [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting and formatting
- Use type hints for better code documentation

**Run linting:**
```bash
cd backend
ruff check .
ruff format .
```

### Frontend (TypeScript/React)

- Follow our linting configuration
- Use TypeScript
- Use semantic HTML and accessible components

**Run linting:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run lint
npm run lint:fix
```

### General Guidelines

- **Code Comments**: Explain why, not what
- **Function Size**: Keep functions small and focused
- **Variable Names**: Use descriptive names
- **Error Handling**: Always handle errors gracefully
- **Security**: Never commit secrets or sensitive data
