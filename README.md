## Introduction

**[Gamgui](https://gamgui.com)** is the open source and self-hostable centrally managed [GAM](https://github.com/GAM-team/GAM) Server. Built for Google IT admins that need to have security, audit logs, access controls, and manage long running GAM jobs with ease.

Built by [Automate Army](https://automatearmy.com) team who is a Google Partner and builds custom software, automations, & AI tools. Automate Army hopes to enable Google IT Admins globally and make their lives easier with Gamgui.

## Features

- **[Dashboard](https://infisical.com/docs/documentation/platform/project)**: Manage secrets across projects and environments (e.g. development, production, etc.) through a user-friendly interface.

## Getting started

Check out the [Quickstart Guides](https://gamgui.com/docs/getting-started/introduction)

### Run Gamgui On GCP

## Open-source vs. paid

This repo available under the [MIT expat license](https://github.com/Infisical/infisical/blob/main/LICENSE), with the exception of the `ee` directory which will contain premium enterprise features requiring a Gamgui license.

As of June 14th, 2025, there are no premium enterprise features and thus a license is not required whatsoever. When new features are released that are part of the entierprise license it will be clear as to what features are in that category.

We do not plan to ever make core features enterprise features.
