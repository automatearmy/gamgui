## Introduction

**[Gamgui](https://gamgui.com)** is a self-hosted, open-source, centrally managed, auditable GAM server. It gives you security, audit logs, access controls, and ability to manage long running jobs with ease.

Built by [Automate Army](https://automatearmy.com) team who is a Google Partner and builds custom software, automations, & AI tools. Automate Army hopes to enable Google IT Admins globally and make their lives easier with Gamgui.

## Features

- **Security & Access Controls**: Centrally manage who can execute GAM commands with role-based permissions and authentication
- **Audit Logs**: Complete visibility into all GAM operations with detailed logging and tracking
- **Long-Running Job Management**: Execute and monitor complex GAM operations that take time to complete
- **Self-Hosted**: Keep your Google Workspace data secure by running Gamgui on your own infrastructure
- **Open Source**: Full transparency with MIT licensing and community-driven development

## Our Vision

We believe Google IT admins should spend less time maintaining systems and more time improving them. Gamgui makes that possible.

As AI tools like Gemini become more capable of automating complex workflows, admins need infrastructure that matches that speed. Gamgui aims to turn GAM into an AI-ready tool for the Google Ecosystem.

Our mission is to eliminate complexity and make enterprise-grade IT automation accessible to every team. Less typing. More impact.

## Getting started

Check out the [Quickstart Guides](https://github.com/automatearmy/gamgui/tree/main/infra)

### Run Gamgui On GCP

Visit our [documentation](https://gamgui.com/docs) for detailed deployment instructions and configuration guides.

## Open-source vs. paid

This repo available under the [MIT expat license](https://github.com/automatearmy/gamgui/blob/main/LICENSE), with the exception of the `ee` directory which will contain premium enterprise features requiring a Gamgui license.

As of June 14th, 2025, there are no premium enterprise features and thus a license is not required whatsoever. When new features are released that are part of the enterprise license it will be clear as to what features are in that category.

We do not plan to ever make core features enterprise features.
