# Code Organization Summary

## What We've Done

1. **Created Organized Directory Structure**
   - `gamgui-app/gamgui-server/scripts/diagnostics/`: For diagnostic and testing scripts
   - `gamgui-app/gamgui-server/scripts/deployment/`: For deployment scripts
   - `gamgui-app/gamgui-server/services/container/adapters/`: For container adapter implementations
   - `gamgui-terraform/kubernetes/`: For Kubernetes YAML configuration files

2. **Moved Files to Appropriate Directories**
   - Diagnostic scripts moved to `gamgui-app/gamgui-server/scripts/diagnostics/`
   - Deployment scripts moved to `gamgui-app/gamgui-server/scripts/deployment/`
   - Adapter files moved to `gamgui-app/gamgui-server/services/container/adapters/`
   - Kubernetes YAML files moved to `gamgui-terraform/kubernetes/`

3. **Updated Require Paths**
   - Created and ran scripts to update require paths in all JavaScript files
   - All files now use dependencies from the appropriate project directories

4. **Created Documentation**
   - Added README files to each directory explaining its purpose and contents
   - Created this summary document

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Application**
   - Run the application to ensure it still works correctly
   - Use the `gamgui-app/gamgui-server/scripts/diagnostics/check-application-status.js` script to verify the application status

2. **Clean Up Root Directory**
   - After verifying that everything works, you can safely remove the original files from the root directory
   - You can also remove the `node_modules` directory from the root directory, as all dependencies are now properly installed in the project directories

3. **Update Deployment Process**
   - Update any CI/CD pipelines or deployment scripts to use the new file locations
   - Ensure that all scripts are executable (`chmod +x *.sh`) in the deployment directory

## How to Use the New Structure

### Running Diagnostic Scripts

```bash
# Navigate to the diagnostics directory
cd gamgui-app/gamgui-server/scripts/diagnostics

# Run a diagnostic script
node check-application-status.js
```

### Running Deployment Scripts

```bash
# Navigate to the deployment directory
cd gamgui-app/gamgui-server/scripts/deployment

# Run a deployment script
./deploy-cloud-run-adapter.sh
```

### Using Adapter Files

The adapter files are not meant to be used directly. They are imported by the main container service implementation in the parent directory.

### Applying Kubernetes YAML Files

```bash
# Navigate to the kubernetes directory
cd gamgui-terraform/kubernetes

# Apply a YAML file
kubectl apply -f gam-session-manager-role.yaml
```

## Conclusion

The codebase is now better organized, with files grouped by their purpose and function. This makes it easier to maintain, understand, and extend the application. The application functionality remains unchanged, but the code is now more structured and follows better practices.
