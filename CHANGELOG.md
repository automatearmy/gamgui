### Gamgui Launch 

We'd like to introduce Gamgui to the world. A self-hosted & centrally managed GAM server 
for Google IT admins that need to have security, audit logs, access controls, 
and manage long running GAM jobs with ease.

All built open-source. 

### Initial Feature Set
- **Audit Logging:** Every GAM action logged to Cloud Logging
- **Privacy:** Runs in your GCP tenant via IAP, no third-party telemetry
- **Easy Setup:** Deploy in a few clicks, update on your schedule
- **User Management:** Control access with Google Groups, keep keys hidden
- **Long-Running Jobs:** Persistent sessions for extended GAM tasks

For more information, email [team@automatearmy.com](mailto:team@automatearmy.com). Full documentation coming soon
