# WebSocket Stream Handling Fix

## Issue Description

The application was experiencing disconnections when executing commands in the terminal. After executing commands like `ls`, the connection would close with a "transport close" error message:

```
$ ls
$: > ls
Disconnected: transport close
Attempting to reconnect...
```

This issue was occurring because the WebSocket streams for stdout and stderr were not being properly handled and closed, leading to connection termination after command execution.

## Root Cause Analysis

The root cause was identified in the `KubernetesAdapter.js` file, specifically in the `executeCommand` method. The PassThrough streams for stdout and stderr were not being properly managed:

1. Error handling was missing for the data processing in the stream handlers
2. The streams were not being explicitly ended when the command completed successfully
3. There was no error handling for the streams themselves
4. When WebSocket errors or closures occurred, the streams were left open

## Solution

The fix involved enhancing the stream handling in the `executeCommand` method:

1. Added try/catch blocks around data processing in stream handlers
2. Added explicit error handlers for the stdout and stderr streams
3. Ensured streams are properly ended when the command completes successfully
4. Added cleanup code to end streams when WebSocket errors or closures occur
5. Improved error logging throughout the method

## Implementation

The changes were made to the `KubernetesAdapter.js` file, specifically enhancing the `executeCommand` method with better stream handling and error management.

## Verification

After implementing these changes:

1. Build and push the updated Docker image using `build-and-push-server.sh`
2. Apply the Terraform changes using `terraform apply`
3. Verify that commands like `ls` now execute without disconnecting the terminal

## Additional Notes

This fix is part of a broader effort to improve the stability and reliability of the terminal connection in the application. The same pattern of stream handling should be applied to other methods that use WebSockets for communication.
